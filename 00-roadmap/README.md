# Cloud-Native Notes

> AWS / Kubernetes / IaC / Distributed Systems — backend engineering perspective.  
> Goal: become a cloud/backend engineer at a North American big tech company, focusing on cloud-native architecture, scalability, and observability (minimizing on-call burden).

---

## Purpose
This repository collects:
- Structured notes (EN/ZH)
- Hands-on labs
- Architecture patterns
- Demo projects

It serves as both a personal knowledge base and a public portfolio.

## Roadmap Overview
1. **AWS Cloud Foundations** → IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, ECS/Fargate  
2. **Kubernetes & Containers** → Pods, Services, Networking, Ingress, RBAC  
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** → Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation  
4. **Distributed Systems** → CAP, consistency models, sharding, messaging (Kafka)  
5. **Observability** → Logging, Metrics, Tracing with OpenTelemetry  
6. **Projects** → Cloud-native apps with end-to-end deployment
